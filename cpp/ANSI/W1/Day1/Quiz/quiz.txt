1. What is the difference between an interpreter and a compiler?
Interpreters are Just-in-time compilers that do not make binaries.  They can be edited like editing a script.  Where as a compiler makes binaries that can't be changed without changing the source code and recompiling.

2. How do you compile the source code with your compiler?
I create a Makefile - that runs the command ```g++ -o PROJECT main.cpp``` creating a binary with the PROJECT name.

3. What does the linker do?
The linker uses the local system libraries (Nix, Windows) to make system calls to the CPU.

4. What are the steps in the normal development cycle?
a) brainstorm
b) roadmap
c) code
d) debug
